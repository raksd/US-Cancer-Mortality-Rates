# US-Cancer-Mortality-Rates
Developing a model to predict cancer mortality rates in the USA. The dataset has variables that are belived to be correlated to cancer mortality rates.
However, there is also Multicollinearity .

The project analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Dealing with Multicollinearity and developing a model

• Exploratory analysis of the dataset including:
o Mortality rates by US state (not county)
o Distribution of mortality rates

•Adressing issues such as:
o Outliers
o Missing values
o Multicollinearity

• Devloping the model:
o Model performance
